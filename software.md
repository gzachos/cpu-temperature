# Software Installation

In addition to an up-to-date Rasbian image, you will also need:

- `rrdtool`
- `apache2` 

Instructions on `Updating and Upgrading Raspbian` can be found [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/updating.md).

The required packages can be installed by opening a terminal and executing the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install rrdtool apache2
```
